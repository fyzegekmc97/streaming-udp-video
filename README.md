Simple UDP streaming application, includes both server and client. Build files can be written however one wants. The project is currently built with the Ninja build system. However one can change the build system (the generator) to whichever one he/she wants, with the -G flag of CMake. In order to do this, one must first delete the automatically generated CMakeCache.txt file though.
